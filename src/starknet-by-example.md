# Starknet by Example

Starknet By Example is a collection of examples of how to use the Cairo programming language to create smart contracts on Starknet.

Cairo is a Turing-complete programming language designed to write provable programs, abstracting the zk-STARK proof system away from the programmer.

If you want to learn more about the Cairo programming language, you can read the [Cairo Book](https://cairo-book.github.io/).
